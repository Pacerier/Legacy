the file </./Syntax> is like the entrypoint/"main"/index.html. it defines the syntax
the file </Words> is interpreted as a list of "word"s. first divide it into lines, each line can start with any char, but if it starts with the char  `-` itself folowed by a space char, and they are not escaped, then that is not content but demarcation, and it indicates the start of a new item in the list right at the point where the space char ends.
ok so these items of the list, each one is a commentary. the subject is all the git commits done before the commit that added that item to the list (plus the commit itself) , ie referring to the changeset, less the part that is referring to the item itself
btw you can only add items to the list not subtract. by appending
darn, just realiez one thing. pretty screwed. that that means you must file in an 'empty' comment to act as a demarcator if you want to refer only to some of the edits ecver since the previous comment.
ok anwyay to conitnue from p2, so if you got 2+ items in a commit, then only the first item is used as the comment. the secnod item is a comment on the first, the 3rd item is a comment on the 2nd, etc etc.
