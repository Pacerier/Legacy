- -attempt n=1
-re filename, i din use changelog because it includes other comments, so its more like commentlog/commentarylog, which acutally log has no meaning so its the same meaning as changes/comments/commentaries n fact log suggests that it cannot be edited therefore its not great. so i ended up with words/messages which however could be better replaced if tehre's a word meaning commentary-or-changemsg
-  re `n` the idea is that if theres a syntax error while creating the syntax then obviously the repo becomes a stillborn. so i'll need to create a new repo from scratch, a complete new start other than n will be increased by 1
