- -attempt n=1
-anuyway it was ytd nightpast12 wanting to slp that time that i tot of that i dun have to finish the syntax doc in one shot cos i can actually use the syntax for itself, like when the syntax doc is changed, then it simply redefines meaning it creates a better definition/undestanding of what has already been done. unless the change is not syntactical (ie machine-understadnable) den it becomes a stillborn
-re filename, i din use changelog because it includes other comments, so its more like commentlog/commentarylog, which acutally log has no meaning so its the same meaning as changes/comments/commentaries n fact log suggests that it cannot be edited therefore its not great. so i ended up with words/messages which however could be better replaced if tehre's a word meaning commentary-or-changemsg
- re `n` the idea is that if theres a syntax error while creating the syntax then obviously the repo becomes a stillborn. so i'll need to create a new repo from scratch, a complete new start other than n will be increased by 1
= it is actually quite intesinrg
- so, looks like i just had to do that demarcation thin g. realized taht fking hell it mightn be quite a common action that i need to do if i not goign to re"x" everywhere
! syntax done
- hope no bugs with the logic else gotta do n=2
p316, ok just realiez that this would be hideous in a monorep so need to rework it
p318, looks like i can jsut give each folder its own changelog acutally. ie a Words file. and global edits can use the top lvl file. ok, in fact, it looks like within a subrep i can khave such folders as well ad infinitum
